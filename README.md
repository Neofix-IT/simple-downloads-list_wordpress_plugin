## How to use the build tools?

First, run `npm install` to install all required npm dependencies. After that you got a few commands to use:

`npm run watch`
Copies files from assets to dist and watches for js / scss changes

`npm run build`
Copies files from assets to dist and builds js/scss files (minified)

`npm run package`
Builds and packages all files into a final zip file (located in the build folder)
